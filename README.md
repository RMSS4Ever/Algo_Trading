Algorythms for Trading

This is where I have officially outgrown MS Excel for creating my algorythims and need to start using python and pandas.

This is my journey into learning how to:
  - Using VS Code
  - Using Python in VS Code
  - Using Pandas
  - Creating data frames of with the information I want
  - Retrieving data from a relationional data base (SQlite and/or Postgres)
  - Using Git/Github to actually keep track of everything and work on the same code from different platforms.

Been at this for many years now. Let's see if I've managed to retain something of use.
